# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. To contribute:

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/ankurk017/RCE_Emanuel) and clone your fork.
2. Create a branch from `development`: `git checkout development && git pull && git checkout -b your-feature`.
3. Make your changes (code, docs, or tests). For the Fortran model, ensure `make rebuild` still builds; for Python, use the `rce` environment.
4. Push your branch and open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ankurk017/RCE_Emanuel/compare) against `development`.

For library or compiler issues on your system, see [Common issues](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) or contact **it@nsstc.uah.edu**.
